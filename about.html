  <h2>About Critical Play</h2>
  <p>
    <em>Critical Play</em> <p>
Critical Play reviews independent games within a broader context of game history, pop culture, and material culture. The goal is to approach games without hype or cynicism, with an open mind and a critical lens shaped by the humanities rather than marketing cycles. My background is in historical research and archival studies, and I bring those tools - context, comparison, and close reading - to interactive media.
</p>

<p>
I have played games across nearly every platform and genre for the past forty years, from early home consoles and arcade cabinets to contemporary PC, mobile, and console ecosystems. That long view informs how I think about games not just as isolated products, but as part of evolving traditions shaped by technology, economics, labor, and audience expectation. Unless otherwise noted, all games are completed on default difficulty settings.
</p>

<p>
By day, I am a librarian with a professional background in archives and local history. Collection development, preservation, access, and information ethics are not abstract concepts for me - they are my daily work. I am also an active game collector, with a particular interest in physical editions, ephemera, manuals, and the ways games exist as objects as much as software. That perspective inevitably shapes how I think about ownership, scarcity, preservation, and the slow disappearance of physical media.
</p>

<p>
While I am well versed in core concepts of game design - systems, feedback loops, difficulty curves, and player psychology - I am not a developer or designer, and I do not write from the position of one. Instead, I write as a critically engaged player, collector, and information professional, interested in how games function, how they communicate meaning, and how they affect us over time.
</p>

<p>
My long-term dream is to one day start a game distribution company focused on bringing independent games into the physical space. At the same time, I fully recognize that the digital realm has democratized game development in unprecedented ways, lowering barriers to entry and helping to usher in a genuine golden age of independent games. Critical Play exists within that tension - between physical and digital, past and present, art and product - and treats games as cultural artifacts worth taking seriously.
</p>

<h2>Ethics and Disclosure</h2>

<p>
Critical Play is committed to transparency and good-faith criticism. Review copies, free keys, or press access will always be disclosed when applicable. Ownership of a physical or digital copy does not imply endorsement, and collecting games does not exempt them from criticism.
</p>

<p>
Reviews are written independently, without paid placement, affiliate influence, or editorial oversight from publishers or developers. Analysis reflects my own perspective as a player, librarian, and collector, shaped by experience rather than industry affiliation. When relevant, historical context, genre conventions, and market realities are acknowledged to provide fair and informed critique.
